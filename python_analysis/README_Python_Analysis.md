# Cell Size Distribution Analyzer

Jupyter notebook for generating publication-ready histograms from ImageJ particle analysis results.

## Description

This Jupyter notebook automatically processes CSV files generated by ImageJ particle analysis to create area and diameter distribution histograms. The notebook calculates equivalent circular diameters from measured areas and generates high-quality plots suitable for publication.

## Installation

Install the required packages by running this cell in your Jupyter notebook:

```python
!pip install pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn
```

**Dependencies**:
- `pandas` - Data handling and CSV processing
- `matplotlib` - Plotting backend
- `numpy` - Mathematical operations and binning
- `seaborn` - Statistical visualization

## Usage

### Preparing Your Data

1. Run the ImageJ macro on your microscopy images
2. Save the Results table as CSV file(s)
3. Place CSV file(s) in the same directory as this notebook

### Running the Analysis

1. Open the Jupyter notebook: `cell_size_analyzer.ipynb`
2. Run all cells (Cell → Run All)
3. The notebook will automatically process all CSV files in the current directory

### Output

For each CSV file, the notebook generates two high-resolution (600 DPI) PNG files:
- `{filename}_areas.png` - Area distribution histogram
- `{filename}_diameters.png` - Diameter distribution histogram

## Key Features

### Automatic Processing
- Detects and processes all CSV files in the directory
- No need to specify individual file names

### Smart Binning
- **Area bins**: 10-unit intervals based on data range
- **Diameter bins**: 1-unit intervals based on data range
- Automatically adjusts to your data distribution

### Scientific Accuracy
- Calculates equivalent circular diameter: `d = 2 × √(Area/π)`
- Proper units with Unicode symbols (μm², μm)
- Publication-ready formatting

### Memory Efficient
- Uses `plt.clf()` to clear plots between files
- Prevents memory buildup during batch processing

## Expected CSV Format

The notebook expects CSV files with an 'Area' column (standard ImageJ output):

```
Area,Circularity,AR,Round,Solidity
245.5,0.892,1.234,0.876,0.923
312.1,0.845,1.456,0.789,0.934
...
```

## Customization

You can modify the binning by changing these lines:
```python
areas_bins = np.arange(np.floor(areas.min()), np.ceil(areas.max()), 10)  # 10-unit bins
diameters_bins = np.arange(np.floor(diameters.min()), np.ceil(diameters.max()), 1)  # 1-unit bins
```

## Troubleshooting

**No CSV files found**: Ensure CSV files are in the same directory as the notebook

**Missing 'Area' column**: Verify your ImageJ Results table includes area measurements

**Memory issues**: The notebook clears plots automatically, but restart the kernel if needed

## Technical Notes

- Assumes circular cell approximation for diameter calculation
- Requires scale to be set in ImageJ for accurate micrometer measurements
- Optimized for cell analysis but works with any circular/spherical particles
